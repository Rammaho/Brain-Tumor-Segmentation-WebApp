# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-WebApp
This brain-tumor segmentation web app allows users to upload a brain MRI slice (PNG or JPEG) and automatically detect tumor regions using a U-Net-based deep learning model inspired by your paper “Bridged-U-Net-ASPP-EVO and Deep Learning Optimization for Brain Tumor Segmentation.”
